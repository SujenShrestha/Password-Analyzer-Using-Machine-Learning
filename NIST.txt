Passwords chosen by subscribers must be at least 8 characters in length, and passwords chosen by the CSP or password verifier must be at least 6 characters in length.

Password verifiers should accept ASCII and Unicode characters, and the use of spaces is also acceptable.

If Unicode characters are accepted in passwords, the password verifier should apply a normalization process using either NFKC or NFKD.

Passwords that are randomly chosen by the CSP or password verifier must be generated using an approved random bit generator and must be at least 6 characters in length.

Password verifiers should not allow subscribers to store hints and should not prompt them to use specific types of information when choosing passwords.

Password verifiers must compare prospective passwords against a list of commonly used, expected, or compromised values and reject passwords that are found in the list.

Password verifiers should offer guidance to subscribers, such as a password-strength meter, to help them choose strong passwords.

Password verifiers must implement a rate-limiting mechanism to limit the number of failed authentication attempts.

Password verifiers should not impose other composition rules for passwords and should not require arbitrary changes of passwords.

Password verifiers should permit claimants to use "paste" functionality when entering a password to facilitate the use of password managers.

Password verifiers should offer options to display the password until it is entered and should also use approved encryption and an authenticated protected channel when requesting passwords.

Passwords must be stored in a form that is resistant to offline attacks and must be salted and hashed using a suitable one-way key derivation function.
